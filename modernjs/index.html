            <h2>Default Params</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    Default params are used as default values if not arguments are passed in. For example in our rollDie
                    function we can have a default number of side for our dice! Watch out because order matters! If you
                    miss a value undefined will be returned.
                </p>

            <h2>Spread</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Spread is like a swiss army knife. Allows an array to be expanded when passed into a function as
                    arguments or array method. We can also spread strings into a function call. We can also use spread
                    with arrays to copy the contents into a new array or combine two arrays. This is a copy of the
                    original. Spread can be used with objects to copy properties into a new object. When spreading
                    properties the last properties take precedence. If we try and spread an array into an object the
                    indices will become the keys and the elements the values.

            <div class="">
                <p>
                    Spread is useful when we are getting data from a user. We can then add our own keys/values such as
                    an
                    id and if the user is admin or not!

            <h2>Rest</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    The arguments object looks like an array. We do not have access to methods, but we can access the
                    length. This is where rest comes in. Rest collects our arguments and puts them in an array. It is
                    the opposite of spread and doesn't spread elements, rest collects them.

            <h2>Destructuring</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    Desctructuring a way of unpacking values from arrays or objects and storing them in distinct
                    variables. It is more common to use with objects. It is more practical because order does not matter
                    in the context of objects. We can rename the properties we extract from an object
                    <code>const { born : birthYear } = user</code>. We can also add default values when destructuring.
                    We can also destructure the object on the way into a function in the parameters.
