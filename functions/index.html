                <p>
                    Functions are reusable, modular blocks of code. We can execute them at a later date in time and we
                    use them all the time! Examples include making a function to roll a die. Instead of writing out 6
                    variables we can create just one function and call it. We can extend the analogy to make a dice with
                    an input that changes the sides of the die. This two step process is critical.
                    You SHOULD define your functions before you call them.

            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a function is a two step process. First we define a function and then we run or invoke
                it. This is how we declare a function: <code>function funcName(){//do something}</code>. Function names
                are camel cased. The code inside the
                curly braces will be run when the function is called. And this is how we invoke the function:
                <code>functionName()</code>.
            </p>

            <h3>Arguments</h3>lipl
            <p>
                Arguments are just a fancy way of saying inputs to our function. For example we can print a custom
                message to the console based on the arguments we pass to the function. It refers to the value passed in.
                When we used methods like <code>array.push(4)</code> this is technically an argument being passed in to
                the push method. The parameters are a variable that represents the value passed in. If we are expected
                an argument and nothing is passed in when the function is called we will get <code>undefined</code>
                returned.

            <div>
                <p>
                    We can pass in multiple arguments to a function. The order matters, so in the example if we switched
                    the order of the parameter the result would be reversed.

                <p>
                    The return keyword! So far we have been console logging, but this is not a value that we can reuse.
                    We need to be able to store values in a variable or use a method on it. We should return a value
                    from our function using the return keyword <code>return</code>. Return will stop the execution of
                    the function.

            <h2>Levelling up our functions</h2>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
                Scope is a challenging concept! So what exactly is scope? Scope refers to variable
                <span></span>"visiability". The place where the variable is declared impacts how it can be accessed.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Function Scope</h2>
            <p>
                If a let variable is defined within a function, we cannot access it from the outer code. If we have a
                conflict and a
                variable with the same name exists outside the function, the function will ignore this outer variable.
            </p>
            <h2>Block Scope</h2>
            <p>
                Block refers to any code held in curly braces such as conditions or loops. <code>var </code> does not
                respect the block scope. <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variables decalred in block only exist
                within that block!
            </p>
            <h2>Lexical Scope</h2>
            <p>
                Lexical Scope means that a function has access to the variables in the outer scope or parent function.
                So in the example
                below we can see that cryForHelp has access to the heroes variable.
            </p>
            <h2>Function Expressions</h2>
            <p>
                There is another way to create a function. That is a function expression. We store the function we have
                created in a variable. When we can the function by using the variable name. We are essentially craeting
                a function with no name but the variable has a name. Functions are values in JavaScript and we can pass
                them around and return a function just like a return value!
            </p>
            <h2>High Order Functions</h2>
            <p>
                A high order function is a function that can be passed around as an argument. For example in callTwice
                we are passing rollDie as an argument. We can also return a function as value from a function. The
                pattern her is the important thing to learn. Sometimes you will also see a function that generates
                another function based on some input! We can capture the return value in a variable. This pattern is
                known as a factory function!

                <h3>What is a Method?</h3>
                <p>
                    A method is a function that is a property on an object. If we inspect the Math object in the console
                    we will see it made up of a bunch of properties. There is a shorthand properties and we can remove
                    the function keyword.
                </p>

                <h3>Is This Scary?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a source of confusion for many! It does not need to stressful. This is typically used inside
                    a method. Let's refer to the code example to help us break down this concept! If we are in a method,
                    then <code>this</code> refers to the object the method belongs to. In the example <code>this</code>
                    refers to the cat object. BUUUUT...this is not always the case! The value can change and depends how
                    we invoke the function. When we invoke the same method as meow2() what happens? We can undefined and
                    this refers to the window object. Why? Every object that we use live inside the window. By defining
                    something out in the open, it is added to the window. NOT the cat object! Whatever is left of the
                    dot is what this is. Even though we cannot see window to the left of meow2 it is the default value.
