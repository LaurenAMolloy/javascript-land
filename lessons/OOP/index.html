        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                When we look at an array in the console, we see this <code>_proto_</code>. What is the prototype? If we
                take an array as an example. An
                array has so many methods that we use all the time. All of those properties live in a property call
                <code>_proto_</code>. The prototype conatins all of the methods we use. BUT the methods do not live on
                every array we make. They live on the prototype! It does matter! Each array has a reference to the proto
                so we can amke use of all the methods! In simplistic terms a prototype is a template! What is the
                different between <code>_proto_</code> and <code>prototype</code>? Prototype is the actual mama object
                whereas
                _proto_ is a just a reference to the mama!

            <p>
                OOP is all about one central idea. That is breaking our code up into objects. We will look at an example
                of where colors are represented using objects. There are a few color systems we work with in web
                develeopment such as Red, Blue, Green values: <code>rgb(244, 54, 23)</code>, Hexidecimal values:
                <code>#76FF32</code> and Hue Saturation Light values, <code>hsl(180, 50%, 30%)</code>. We can make
                recipes that create new objects with methods and propertoes baked in. We are essentially using a cookie
                cutter. In the code the following things happen...
            </p>
            <ul class="li">We pass in values</ul>
            <ul class="li">We create an object</ul>
            <ul class="li">We add some methods</ul>
            <ul class="li">We return that object</ul>

        <h2>Constructor Functions</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                Why do we need a better solution than factory functions? If we check if the methods we are using in
                makeColor are equal they are not. That is because a new method is created for each object, so they are
                not
                equal. If we tried the same thing with a string then then we would get true returned to us in the
                console. This is because string methods are not defined on every single string! The same applies to
                arrays. This is where the constructor functions enters!

        <h2>Let's Make a Constructor Function</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                We create a constructor function using the function keyword, function name and then assign properties
                inside the function using <code>this</code>. Then to use the constructor function to make our new color
                object we need to use the <code>new</code> keyword. This is what happens...
            </p>
            <ul class="li">Creates a blank object</ul>
            <ul class="li">Links this object to another</ul>
            <ul class="li">Passes the newly craeted object from step 1 to this</ul>
            <ul class="li">Returns this</ul>
            <p>
                If we do not use the new keyword this will refer to the window. Now when we check in the console if
                <code>>color1.hex === color2.hex</code> this will be true because they are the same methods stored on
                the original constructor. The syntax is kind of annoying and this is where classes come in.

                Classes are just syntactical sugar. This means it is a nicer way of building a new object. The steps are
                as follows...
            </p>
            <ul class="li">Creates a class</ul>
            <ul class="li">Call constructor which runs straight away and pass in any arguments</ul>
            <ul class="li">Use this to assign properties to the return object</ul>
            <ul class="li"></ul>

        <h2>Extends and Super</h2>
        <div class="">
            <p>
                In JavaScript, the class syntax provides a cleaner, more structured way to work with objects and
                inheritance. When you have a base class—say, Pet—and you want to create specific types like Dog or Cat,
                you can use the extends keyword to inherit properties and methods from that base class.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that both Dog and Cat can share all the common functionality from Pet without needing to
                rewrite it. The extends keyword is incredibly useful because it helps keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat
                Yourself) and makes it easier to maintain and scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you extend a class, you can also call the parent class’s constructor and methods using the super
                keyword. This allows your subclass to build upon the base class’s functionality while still adding its
                own unique behavior.
