                    We make requests ALL the time. We can make a request from code. This is called AJAX and refers to
                    code that interacts with a server to request data to display in the browser. We can see in the
                    network response tab any information
                    that has been loaded. When we just want data to use on website, for example live price of the
                    stockmarket, we can request that data without refreshing the page. We usually recieve this data in
                    the JSON format. What is JSON?

            <h2>API</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    API refers to Application Programming Interface. It is an interface that responds to HTTP(Hyper Text
                    Transfer Protocal) requests. When we access data this way we access an end point that exposes
                    specific data in JSON format. We can access data for weather, bitcoin, twitter, share facebook posts
                    or auto-response to mentions in instagram. So not only can we retrieve data we can send data via
                    HTTPS requests.

            <div class="">
                <p>
                    XML is a way to store data, it is not commonly used. These days we use JSON which refers to
                    JavaScript Object Notation. JSON data looks like an object in unordered sets of key/value pairs.
                    Keys are stored in double quotes. JSON is not exclusively made for JavaScript. JSON can be used by
                    other languages. We receive the data as a big string. We parse the information using the JSON()
                    method into a valid JavaScript object. We can convert our data into JSON using JSON.stringify(),
                    this allows us to share information via JSON.

                    made for developers. We can amke requests from the browser. We will be using <a

            <div class="">
                <p>
                    We use these verbs to define the type of request we will make. A <code>GET</code> request is used to
                    retreive information. Whereas a <code>POST</code> request is usually used when we want to send data
                    to a server. Status codes are just code that comes back from a HTTP code. 200 is the most common and
                    this means the request was a success. If we get a 404 this is usually when you make a request that
                    is not found. Codes that start with 300 usually mean some kind of redirection.

            <h2>Understanding Query Strings</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    There will be times when we want to access specific resources and add variables to our end points.
                    In the example the colon indicates this: <code>/people/:id/</code>. We can also use a query string.
                    They are made up of key value pairs and separated by ampersand like this
                    <code>sort=desc&color=blue</code>. If we search on a site we will see the query string in the URL.
                    Normally the server is set up to look for a value called q and uses the search as the value. Some
                    endpoints require two queryStrings. Headers are additional pairs of information that go along with
                    the request. We also receive headers in the response. Some API's are set up in a way we have to send
                    headers. We can set headers in postman or hopp scotch.

                <p>
                    This is the old school way of doing things! It does not support callbacks. There is lots of weird
                    caps and it has a clunky syntax. Let's go!

            <h2>Fetch is Awesome!</h2>
            <h3>Fetch supports promises!</h3>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    When we use <code>fetch()</code> we are returned a promise! A request is sent to a URL, if resolved
                    we pass the value to a .then() success handler. We then use the <code>.json()</code> method to parse
                    the data. Pass it to another .then success handler and log our data to the console. This is so much
                    better than xml because our code is flat, there is no nesting and we can make a second request very
                    easily!

                <h3>Axios</h3>
                <p>
                    Axios is a library used to make requests. It does everything in one line and combines fetch and the
                    json method in one line. We can also use axios to set headers. We can pass headers into axios.get as
                    a second argument in the form of a config object. Here is an example of a request made using axios
                    and a config object used to include query parameters.
