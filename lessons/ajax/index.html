                    We make requests ALL the time. We can make a request from code. This is called AJAX and refers to
                    code that interacts with a server to request data. We can see in the notwork tab any infotmation
                    that has been loaded.

            <h2>Single Threaded</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    JavaScript is single threaded. This mean one line is excecuted at once. But what is that particulat
                    script takes five seconds? Will everythig grind to a halt? Will our app just stop? There are work
                    arounds. For example we have <code>setTimeout</code>. Settimeout expects a fucntion as an argument
                    and a second argument as time in milliseconds! What happens? Well under the hood the browser (which
                    is written in c++) takes care of this task. This includes any task that takes time. JavaScript is
                    not in charge of this.

            <div class="">
                <p>
                    If we want certain scripts to execute consecutively after a certain period of time we can use nested
                    callback functions! In the example we are using setTimeOut to change the background color of this
                    section We could wrap this in a function to make it more reusable. But it does not really solve the
                    problem. Another pattern of using callbacks taht is also very common. Something like if it works run
                    this...If it doesn't work run this. Often we will have more than one callback passed intoi a
                    function for asychronous tasks.

            <h2>Promises Intro</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
                    We might want to create a chain of three requests that are dependent on the previous request being
                    successful. Prior to promises two callbacks, success and failure, were added to requests. The result
                    was callback hell. Promises are the solution to this problem! What does the syntax look like? Let's
                    take a look in the next section!

            <h2>The Magic of Promises</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    We can make a request and have a <code>.then</code> to handle the success value. We can the return
                    another promise and inside the next success handler return another promise. We can use a single
                    <code>.catch</code> for each request! If at any point our promises are not resolved our .catch will
                    run.
                </p>

            <h2>Let's Write a Promise!</h2>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    First we create a promise using the <code>new Promise</code> keyword and pass in a function with two
                    paramaters, resolve and reject which represent the resolution of the promise. If at any point you
                    call resolve, the promise will be resolved and if you call reject the promis will be rejected!

            <h2>Async Functions</h2>
            <h3>Syntactical Sugar!</h3>
            <div class="">
                <p>
                    Async and await make promises pretty! In terms of our code. When we place the word
                    <code>async</code> in front of a function the value we are returned is resolved with a promise. If
                    there are any errors we can throw an Error and the promise is magically rejected. Await is used with
                    async and the purpose of this keyword is to wait until the promise is resolved! In the demo when
                    each promise is resolved the next line will run!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="asyncColorChanger"></div>
            <div class="">
                <h3>Errors!</h3>
                <p>
                    What about errors? We can use a try.catch block which basically is saying to JavaScript. If this
                    code results in an error being thrown we are going to catch it and handle it here!
